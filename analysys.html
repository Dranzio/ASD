<div><h2>Summary of Stream</h2>
  <h4>The stream was essentially just 2 people playing a game with one of them (Joshua) only having the game
for 1 week prior.
The moments leading up to the stream had lots of problems, some were serious and had to be addressed lest the viewers‚Äô enjoyment would be reduced (such as the audio mixing being off) but the main host was able to salvage the technical difficulties by ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù opening their mic and acting like an amateur streamer (which we technically are) who is ‚Äúfixing their stream issues‚Äù for comic effect.
At the beginning of the stream, 15:38secs in, The main Host (Joshua)‚Äôs ears were blasted by the audio of the video game‚Äôs opening screen.
30:38secs in, the main host accidentally does a misinput and fires their smoke canister due to panic causing a small funny scene.
At the 1:21:20 mark of the J05hu4 stream ( was not captured on the lifelabsplayeractionteam stream due to the host(Andrew) leaving prematurely), J05hu4 was asked by a viewer, louisapanda101 to perform a verse of a song he had previously written (with 1k views mild flex) called ‚ÄúLycentian Lurgy‚Äù This was a highlight of the stream at least for him (me).

Aside from that, the rest of the stream was actually just 2 hours of the hosts failing the matches by such close margins and conversing with the players unfortunate enough to be on their team 
At the stream of LPAT the host look distracted because his family have to go somewhere and they need to get ready early the reason why the host leave the matches early.
</h4>
<h2>Strengths of Our Stream</h2>
<h4>We were able to stream the game with no problems and most of our materials for streaming are functioning very well, like the camera and microphone. The quality of the video is also good, pretty clear. The resolution is 1080p. However, the stream was a bit laggy.
The host was very entertaining and a good singer also. The layout was pretty simple, creative and childish but understandable since it's first time. All in all, the stream was pretty good, especially for a first time streamer.
</h4>
<h2>Areas of Opportunities for Our Stream</h2>
<h4>Viewer engagement was hindered because our emcee thought he couldn‚Äôt talk to the viewers due to a miscommunication.
Chat engagement was also hindered greatly due to lack of planning and forgetting to plug in a phone to monitor it.
The stream layout was also rushed causing chat to either take up too much space on the lifelabsplayeractionteam stream and straight up not be visible on the main J05hu4 stream.
One of our hosts was also unable to speak due to technical issues with their mic and headphones muting either the game or the co-host.
If the host was able to fix his lighting and actually show his face on stream, i believe people would be more invested in watching that said person play the game
One of the host was lagging because the streaming software and the game were both open and the internet was not strong enough
</h4>
<h2>Analysis of the Engagement of Our Viewers</h2>
<h4>Engagement was at bare minimum due to one of the hosts forgetting to charge their phone so whenever they had to see chat, they had to manually alt-tab to the chat window in order to respond causing the game to mute while out of the window which is inconvenient.
 The viewers were engaged quite a bit because of the moderators keeping the viewers hyped. The stream got quite an engagement for a while because of us getting a little help from our classmates to watch our stream for like 5 mins or more. The host kinda have some contents like telling jokes to interact with the viewers
The main ‚ÄúGimmick‚Äù the host could provide to the stream is the song request where viewers can ask the host to sing a song if the host fails a match. The host had to sing 5 viewer requested songs out of 6 matches.
Both of the hosts were also unable to set up streamlabs causing them to not be notified of new followers and subscribers, and such, causing the viewers to not be encouraged as much to follow the channel.
</h4>
<h2>Analysis of the Viewership of Our Stream</h2>
<h4>While we cannot say for sure why the stream had a high viewership (7 viewers and 5 active chatters for a no-name streamer is considered high), we can make educated guesses and theories as to why we got the views that we did.
<br>
1.The stream had the words ‚ÄúDebut‚Äù on it, usually used by vtubers and so we have a theory that a majority of the original attention it got was due to viewers seeing ‚ÄúDebut‚Äù and mistaking it for a Vtuber debut.
<br>
2.The advertisements probably worked which we actually did not expect.<br>
3.People we invited actually decided to watch us.<br>
4.Our rudimentary setup probably attracted a few heads due to how eye-catchingly bad it was.
<br>
5.The viewers stayed because the host was new and were likely interested in watching a streamer.
<br>
6.The admins get the chat much more engaged so that the viewers didn‚Äôt get bored watching and stayed a little bit longer in the stream.
